    <p id="tribute-info"><a id="tribute-link" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kenneth_Keller" target="_blank">Sister Keller</a> was ahead of her time – she believed in the power and importance of women in STEM, and she made some impressive predictions about AI and the internet. Her passion for math, physics, and eventually computing led her to make important contributions, like helping to develop the programming language BASIC.</p>
    <p>Keller was born in Cleveland, Ohio on December 17, 1913 to John Adam Keller and Catherine Josephine Keller. She officially became a nun, taking her vows at the age of 27 in 1940.</p>
    <p>she began studying at DePaul University, earning a B.S in Mathematics and an M.S. in Mathematics and Physics. In 1965, Mary Kenneth Keller was the first woman in the US to be awarded a PhD in Computer Science (from the University of Wisconsin-Madison).</p>
    <p>At Dartford, they made an exception to their strict "no men" policy, and Mary worked on developing the BASIC programming language. BASIC is a way of translating the zeroes and ones of computer code into something more intuitive and straightforward. It is a general-purpose, high level programming language which helped broaden computer programming into non maths and science fields, subsequently giving many people their first experience with programming.</p>
    <p>Sister Keller didn’t keep her talent and knowledge to herself; in addition to being an incredible computer scientist, she was also a fantastic educator! After earning her PhD, she founded the computer science department at Clarke College in Iowa, which she went on to direct for 20 years.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller will go down in history as one of the most inspiring and pioneering women who helped make computer programming better, not just for women, but for everyone.</p>
